# Getting Started

## Update Cougarnet

Make sure you have the most up-to-date version of Cougarnet installed by
running the following in your `cougarnet` directory:

```bash
$ git pull
$ python3 setup.py build
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
```

Remember that you can always get the most up-to-date documentation for
Cougarnet [here](https://github.com/cdeccio/cougarnet/blob/main/README.md).


## Resources Provided

The files given to you for this lab are the following:
 - `headers.py` - a file containing a stub implementation IPv4 and TCP header
   classes, as well as a working version of a UDP header class.  This is where
   you will do your work.
 - `test_headers.py` - a file containing unit tests, which will be used to test
   IPv4 and TCP header implementations.  You will also do your work here!
 - `host.py` - a file containing a basic implementation of a host.  Note that
   this is pared down version of the `Host` class you implemented in the
   [Network-Layer Lab](https://github.com/cdeccio/byu-cs460-f2021/lab-network-layer/)
   in which the `send_packet()` method simply picks an outgoing interface,
   creates a frame with the broadcast address as its destination, and sends the
   frame out the interface.
 - `transporthost.py` - a file containing a stub implementation of a host with
   transport-layer capabilities.  It inherits from `Host` and overrides the
   `handle_udp()` and `handle_tcp()` methods.  You will also do your work here!
 - `mysocket.py` - a file containing a stub code for both a UDP and a TCP
   socket.  You will also do your work here!
 - `echoserver.py` and `nc.py` - files containing classes for applications that
   use your UDP socket implementation, specifically, an echo server and a very
   simply Netcat, respectively.
 - `scenario1.cfg` and `scenario2.cfg` -
   [network configuration files](https://github.com/cdeccio/cougarnet/blob/main/README.md#network-configuration-file)
   for testing your implementations.  Both contain the same network topology,
   but they each run different scripts in which different packets are sent.
 - `scenario1.py` and `scenario2.py` - scripts that run various tests in
   conjunction with the network configuration files.


## Topology

The files `scenario1.cfg` and `scenario2.cfg` describe two different scenarios,
but the network topology is the same for both: hosts `a`, `b`, and `c` are
connected to each other via a single switch, `s1`.

```
          +----+
          | a  |
          +----+
            |
            |
            |
+---+     +----+
| b | --- | s1 |
+---+     +----+
            |
            |
            |
          +----+
          | c  |
          +----+
```

`s1` has switching functionality already built in, and all hosts have the
basic functionality of taking a packet, encapusulating in an Ethernet frame,
and sending it to the appropriate host on its LAN/subnet.  What you will be
adding is the transport-layer functionality--building TCP and UDP headers for
application-layer data, adding an IPv4 header, and associating those packets
with their appropriate sockets.

## Starter Commands

Take a look at the contents of `scenario1.cfg`.  Then run the following to
start it up:

Run the following command:

```bash
$ cougarnet --disable-ipv6 --display scenario1.cfg
```

At this point, the only output will be log messages indicating that messages
are being sent from the `NetcatUDP` instance on hosts `a` and `c` to a remote
address and port.  While eventually (after the first message) there is an
instance of `EchoServerUDP` running on host `b`, none of the messages will
actually be sent, nor will they be received or returned by that `EchoServerUDP`
instance on `b`.  That is because the socket implementations that are
responsible for sending and receiving have yet to be fleshed out--by you!  In
the end, you will log messages indicating that your UDP messages were sent by
`a` and `c` and received by `b`, and the responses were seen by `a` and `c`.


# Part 1 - IPv4, UDP, and TCP Headers

In this part of the lab, you will write the code that will build and parse
IPv4, UDP, TCP headers.  While you have been able to get by with poking
existing headers up to this point, you will want a reliable code base for
reading and writing headers because you will be using them a lot more.


## Instructions

Complete steps 1 and 2 below to develop a code base that correctly builds and
parses IPv4, UDP, and TCP headers.  Read both steps before you begin, as it
might be easier for you to do them at the same time.


### Step 1 - Write the Code for Building and Parsing Headers

In the file `headers.py`, flesh out the `from_bytes()` and `to_bytes()` methods
in both the `IPv4Header` class and the `TCPHeader` class.  This will allow you
to create headers for each protocol from raw `bytes` instances, i.e., as read
from the wire.  Note that `UDPHeader.from_bytes()` and `UDPHeader.to_bytes()`
are fleshed out for you, to give you an idea of how this should go.


#### IPv4 Header

Please note that the diagram describing the IPv4 header is 32 bits (columns)
wide.
<table border="1">

</table>
(See also http://www.networksorcery.com/Enp/protocol/ip.htm)

 - Version - IP version.  This will always be 4 for the IPv4 header.
 - IHL - Internet header length in 4-byte words.  The IPv4 header is 20 bytes long without
   options, so this field will always be 5.
 - Differentiated Services - This will always be 0 for our purposes.
 - Total length - This is the length of the entire IP datagram, including IP header and payload.
 - Identification - The ID field for reassembling fragmented packets.  We will not be handling
   fragmentation in this, so this field can be 0.
 - Flags - Same.
 - Fragment offset - Same.
 - TTL - Time-to-live value.  We will initialize this to 64 for any newly-create IPv4 packets.
 - Protocol - The protocol associated with the next header.  For example TCP (`IPPROTO_TCP = 6`)
   or UDP (`IPPROTO_UDP = 17`).
 - Header checksum - The checksum of the IPv4 header.  For the purposes of this lab, we will not
   be calculating a checksum, so 0 can be used here.
 - Source IP address
 - Destination IP address
 - Options and padding ::: - Not used.

#### UDP Header

Please note that the diagram describing the UDP header is 32 bits (columns)
wide.

 - Source Port
 - Destination Port
 - Length - This is the length of the entire UDP datagram, including UDP header and payload.
 - Checksum - The checksum of a pseudo IPv4 header.  For the purposes of this lab, we will
   not be calculating a UDP checksum, so 0 can be used here.

#### TCP Header

Please note that the diagram describing the TCP header is 32 bits (columns)
wide.

(See also http://www.networksorcery.com/Enp/protocol/tcp.htm)

 - Source Port
 - Destination Port
 - Sequence Number
 - Acknowledgment Number
 - Data Offset - The length of the TCP header in 4-byte words.  The TCP header is
   20 bytes long without options, so this field will always be 5.
 - reserved - always 0
 - ECN - Explicit Congestion Notification.  This will not be used in this lab,
   so this field can always be 0.
 - Control Bits (flags) - Each flag is listed below from left to right (most
   significant to least significant).  However, note that only the `SYN` and `ACK`
   flags are likely to be used for this lab.
   - `URG`
   - `ACK`
   - `PSH`
   - `RST`
   - `SYN`
   - `FIN`
 - Window - the receive window advertised by the sending host
 - Checksum - The checksum of a pseudo IPv4 header.  For the purposes of this lab, we will
   not be calculating a TCP checksum, so 0 can be used here.
 - Urgent Pointer - Not used for this lab, so this field can always be 0.


### Step 2 - Complete and Tests Code against Unit Tests

The file `test_headers.py` contains a suite of tests that use python's
[unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).  Like the
[doctest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html), the
`unittest` module provides a way for automated testing of different aspects of
your code.  For each header class, there is a `bytes` instance containing the
raw bytes of the header, to be converted to an object, as well as an
instantiated header object, to be converted to `bytes`.

Run the following to test your header-handling code:

```bash
python3 test_headers.py
```

or, alternatively:

```bash
python3 -m unittest test_headers.py
```

If you have made any changes to the code in `headers.py`, the tests will most
likely fail.  That is because `headers.py` must be populated with the correct
_expected_ values.  Each place in which `correct_value` is assigned a
placeholder value, that placeholder must be replaced with the correct value.
Note that the correct values of `correct_value` for testing the `UDPHeader`
class have already been included, to give you an idea of how this should go.


# Part 2 - UDP Sockets

The `mysocket.py` file contains a stub implementation of a UDP socket in
the `UDPSocket` class.  Instantiating the class involves passing local address
(`local_addr`) and local port (`local_port`), which are the equivalent of
creating a socket with (`socket()`) and calling `bind()` on it.  Thus, an
instantiated `UDPSocket` object knows the destination address and port
associated with all UDP/IP packets arriving to it, and the source address and
port associated with all UDP/IP packets that are sent from it.

Note that, in addition to the local address and port, two functions are passed
as arguments to `UDPSocket.__init__()` and assigned as callable members
variables.  That is, they can be used just like methods.
`UDPSocket._send_ip_packet()` is what is called to send an IP datagram that is
ready to be encapsulated in an Ethernet frame and sent out of one of the host's
interface.  In fact, this function is just a pointer to the bound
`Host.send_packet()` method associated with the host for which the `UDPSocket`
was created.  `UDPSocket._notify_on_data()` is simply a function called by the
socket instance to let the application know there is data.

The two methods `UDPSocket.sendto()` and `UDPSocket.recvfrom()` represent the
functions of the same names in the socket API, for sending and receiving data
respectively.  The idea is that `UDPSocket.sendto()` and `UDPSocket.recvfrom()`
are called by the applications, as a socket-like API, just as would be done
with real sockets.  These methods, in turn, call other methods, which you will
flesh out as part of your UDP socket implementation, such as
`UDPSocket.handle_packet()` and `UDPSocket.send_packet()`.  For example:

```python
sock.sendto(b'abc123', '192.0.2.1', 1234)
```

and:

```python
data, remote_addr, remote_port = sock.recvfrom()
```


## Packets Issued

With `scenario1.cfg`, the following packets are sent at the times noted:
Each sub-bullet describes the purpose of the primary bullet under which it is
listed.

 - 5 seconds: Host `a` instantiates a `UDPSocket`, `s`, as part of a
   `NetcatUDP` application and calls:
   ```python
   s.sendto(b'...', '10.0.0.2', 1234)
   ```
   - There is no service listening on 10.0.0.2 port 1234
 - 6 seconds: Host `b` starts an instance of `EchoServerUDP` on port 1234
   - There is now a service listening on 10.0.0.2 port 1234
 - 7 seconds: Host `a` instantiates a `UDPSocket`, `s`, as part of a
   `NetcatUDP` application and calls:
   ```python
   s.sendto(b'...', '10.0.0.2', 1234)
   ```
   It waits for a message in return and calls `s.recvfrom()`.
   - There is now a service listening on 10.0.0.2 port 1234 to respond to the
     UDP msg
 - 8 seconds: Host `c` instantiates a `UDPSocket`, `s`, as part of a
   `NetcatUDP` application and calls:
   ```python
   s.sendto(b'...', '10.0.0.2', 1234)
   ```
   It waits for a message in return and calls `s.recvfrom()`.
   - There is a service listening on 10.0.0.2 port 1234 to respond to the
     UDP msg


## Instructions

In the file `mysocket.py`, flesh out following the skeleton methods:

 - `create_packet()`.  This method is used create a packet to be sent to a
   remote host.  Use the `src`, `sport`, `dst`, `dport`, and `data` arguments
   to create a UDP datagram with IP header, UDP header, and UDP payload (i.e.,
   `data`).  The method should return a `bytes` instance that is ready to be
   sent on the wire--after an Ethernet frame header is added.

 - `send_packet()`.  This method is used to create and send a UDP datagram.  It
   is what is called by `UDP.sendto()`.  Use the `remote_addr`, `remote_port`,
   and `data` arguments to create and send an UDP datagram with IP header, UDP
   header, and UDP payload (i.e., `data`).  Note that this function should
   largely be implemented by calling `UDPHeader.create_packet()` and
   `UDPHeader._send_ip_packet()`.

 - `handle_packet()`.  This method takes the following as an argument:

   - `pkt`: an IP packet, complete with IP header.  Generally, this could be
     either an IPv4 or an IPv6 packet, but for the purposes of this lab, it
     will just be IPv4.

   The method should simply parse the packet, append the data to the socket's
   buffer, along with the remote IP address and port from which it originated,
   and call `self._notify_on_data()` to let the application know that there is
   data to be read.  When the application calls `UDP.recvfrom()` it will return
   the contents of the earliest received UDP datagram that has not been read.

At this point, you should be able to run the following command to run scenario
1:

```bash
$ cougarnet --disable-ipv6 --display --wireshark s1 scenario1.cfg
```

You have 5 seconds to select the `s1-b` interface before the UDP packet is sent
by host `a`.  At this point, you should see a log message indicating that host
`a` is sending the message, you should see that packet in your Wireshark
output, and you should see a log message indicating that it was received by
host `b`.  However, you should not expect to see a log message that it has been
received by the application running on `b`.  Nor should you see a return packet
in the Wireshark output.  That is because you are missing the transport-layer
multiplexing--the glue that passes the incoming packets to their correct
socket.

In the file `transporthost.py`, flesh out following method:

 - `handle_udp()`.  This method takes the following as an argument:

   - `pkt`: an IP packet, complete with IP header.  Generally, this could be
     either an IPv4 or an IPv6 packet, but for the purposes of this lab, it
     will just be IPv4.

   It is called by `handle_ip()` when the packet is determined to be a UDP
   packet. `handle_udp()` should look for a open UDP socket corresponding to
   the destination address and destination port of the incoming packet.  If
   such a mapping is found, then the `handle_packet()` method is called on that
   socket.  This is the one you fleshed out earlier!  See several examples of
   where it is called for both client and server in `scenario1.py`.

   If there is no mapping found, then call the `no_socket_udp()` method.  At
   this point, you do not need to flesh out the `no_socket_udp()` method; it is
   simply a placeholder.


## Testing

Test your implementation against scenario 1.  _After_ the service has been
started, the output should show that `a` sent the UDP datagram and that `b`
received the UDP datagram--both at the host level and the application levels
(it will look a little redundant, but the logging happens at both layers).  The
output should also show that `a` received the echoed message, both at the host
level and the application level.  After the exchange between hosts `a` and `b`,
you should see output for a similar exchange between hosts `c` and `b`.

When it is working properly, test also with the `--terminal=none` option:

```bash
$ cougarnet --disable-ipv6 --terminal=none scenario1.cfg
```


# Part 3 - TCP Sockets and Three-Way Handshake

The `mysocket.py` file also contains a stub implementation of a TCP socket in
the `TCPSocket` class.  Typically the `TCPSocket` class is instantiated in one
of two ways:

 - With call to the class method `TCPSocket.connect()`, in which:
   - a new `TCPSocket` instance is created with a given local address, local
     port, remote address, and remote port, and an initial state of `CLOSED`;
     and
   - the `initiate_connection()` method is called on the newly created socket,
     starting the TCP three-way handshake.  Note that this method will change
     the state to `SYN_SENT`.
   Additionally, the 4-tuple of local address, local port, remote address, and
   remote port is mapped to the newly created `TCPSocket` instance on the host,
   but that is not done within the method.
 - When an instance of the `TCPListenerSocket` class calls its own
   `handle_packet()` method.  Because a new socket is required for every TCP
   connection, the `TCPListenerSocket` class exists to simply handle packets
   that are for new TCP connection requests, instantiating a new `TCPSocket`
   with each request, so each 4-tuple (remote address, remote port, local
   address, local port) uniquely maps to its own `TCPSocket` instance.  In the
   `handle_packet()` method:
   - a new `TCPSocket` instance is created with a given local address, local
     port, remote address, and remote port, and an initial state of `LISTEN`;
   - the 4-tuple of local address, local port, remote address, and remote port is
     mapped to the newly created `TCPSocket` instance on the host; and
   - the `handle_packet()` method is called on the newly created socket,
     handling the first packet received on the server side of the TCP three-way
     handshake.  Note that this method will change the state to `SYN_RECEIVED`.

From this point on, when a packet, `pkt`, is received by a `TCPSocket` instance, `sock`,
the following is called:

```python
sock.handle_packet(pkt)
```
The `handle_packet()` method first checks the state of the connection.  If the
connection is not `ESTABLISHED`, then it calls the `continue_connection()`
method.  The `continue_connection()` method looks like this:

```python
if self.state == TCP_STATE_LISTEN:
    self.handle_syn(pkt)
elif self.state == TCP_STATE_SYN_SENT:
    self.handle_synack(pkt)
elif self.state == TCP_STATE_SYN_RECEIVED:
    self.handle_ack_after_synack(pkt)
```

The implementation of the three helper functions (`handle_syn()`,
`handle_synack()`, and `handle_ack_after_synack()`) is your task.
Once you flesh them out, the TCP three-way handshake will be complete and the
connection established!

The whole process should look something like this, which is an example taken
directly from RFC 793:
```

        TCP A                                                TCP B

    1.  CLOSED                                               LISTEN

    2.  SYN-SENT    --> <SEQ=100><CTL=SYN>               --> SYN-RECEIVED

    3.  ESTABLISHED <-- <SEQ=300><ACK=101><CTL=SYN,ACK>  <-- SYN-RECEIVED

    4.  ESTABLISHED --> <SEQ=101><ACK=301><CTL=ACK>       --> ESTABLISHED

    5.  ESTABLISHED --> <SEQ=101><ACK=301><CTL=ACK><DATA> --> ESTABLISHED

    (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.4)

```


## Packets Issued

With `scenario2.cfg`, the following packets are sent at the times noted:
Each sub-bullet describes the purpose of the primary bullet under which it is
listed.

 - 5 seconds: Host `a` calls:
   ```python
   TCPSocket.connect('10.0.0.1', <randomport>, '10.0.0.2', 1234, ...))
   ```
   which both creates a `TCPSocket` instance and initiates the TCP three-way
   handshake.
   - There is no service listening on 10.0.0.2 port 1234
 - 6 seconds: Host `b` creates a `TCPListenerSocket`:
   ```python
   TCPListenerSocket('10.0.0.2', 1234, ...)
   ```
   - There is now a service listening on 10.0.0.2 port 1234
 - 7 seconds: Host `a` calls:
   ```python
   TCPSocket.connect('10.0.0.1', <randomport>, '10.0.0.2', 1234, ...))
   ```
   which both creates a `TCPSocket` instance and initiates the TCP three-way
   handshake.
   - There is now a service listening on 10.0.0.2 port 1234
 - 8 seconds: Host `a` sends a TCP packet from a `TCPSocket` instance, with a
   new randomly-selected source port, pretending that it already has an
   established connection (i.e., client-side socket has state `ESTABLISHED` and
   packet does not have `SYN` flag set).
   - There is no TCP socket associated with the 4-tuple of the incoming TCP
     packet.
 - 9 seconds: Host `c` calls:
   ```python
   TCPSocket.connect('10.0.0.3', <randomport>, '10.0.0.2', 1234, ...))
   ```
   which both creates a `TCPSocket` instance and initiates the TCP three-way
   handshake.
   - There is a service listening on 10.0.0.2 port 1234


## Instructions

In the file `mysocket.py`, flesh out following the skeleton methods:

 - `create_packet()`.  This method is used create a packet to be sent to a
   remote host.  Use the `src`, `sport`, `dst`, `dport`, and `data` arguments
   to create a TCP packet with IP header, TCP header, and optional TCP segment
   (i.e., `data`).  The method should return a `bytes` instance that is ready
   to be sent on the wire--after an Ethernet frame header is added.

 - `send_packet()`.  This method is used to create and send a TCP packet.
   It will be used both for control packets (e.g., those associated with the
   three-way handshake) as well as any packets with segment data.  Note that
   this method should largely be implemented by calling
   `TCPHeader.create_packet()` and `TCPHeader._send_ip_packet()`.

 - `handle_syn()`.  This method takes the following as an argument:

   - `pkt`: an IP packet, complete with IP header.  Generally, this could be
     either an IPv4 or an IPv6 packet, but for the purposes of this lab, it
     will just be IPv4.

   Handle an incoming TCP SYN packet.  Ignore the packet if the `SYN` flag is
   not sent.  Save the sequence in the packet as the base sequence of the
   remote side of the connection.  Send a corresponding SYNACK packet, which
   includes both our own base sequence number and an acknowledgement of the
   remote side's sequence number (base + 1).  Transition to state
   `SYN_RECEIVED`.

 - `handle_synack()`.  This method takes the following as an argument:

   - `pkt`: an IP packet, complete with IP header.  Generally, this could be
     either an IPv4 or an IPv6 packet, but for the purposes of this lab, it
     will just be IPv4.

   Handle an incoming TCP SYNACK packet.  Ignore the packet if the `SYN` flag
   is not yet, the `ACK` flag is not set, or if the ack field does not
   represent our current sequence (base + 1).  Save the sequence in the packet
   as the base sequence of the remote side of the connection.  Send a
   corresponding ACK packet, which includes both our current sequence number
   (base + 1) and an acknowledgement of the remote side's sequence number
   (base + 1).  Transition to state `ESTABLISHED`.

 - `handle_ack_after_synack()`.  This method takes the following as an argument:

   - `pkt`: an IP packet, complete with IP header.  Generally, this could be
     either an IPv4 or an IPv6 packet, but for the purposes of this lab, it
     will just be IPv4.

   Handle an incoming TCP ACK packet.  Ignore the packet if the `SYN` flag is
   set, the `ACK` flags is not set, or the ack field does not represent our
   current sequence (base + 1).  Transition to state `ESTABLISHED`.

At this point, you should be able to run the following command to run scenario
2:

```bash
$ cougarnet --disable-ipv6 --display --wireshark s1 scenario2.cfg
```

You have 5 seconds to select the `s1-b` interface before the initial TCP SYN
packet is sent by host `a`.  At this point, you should see log messages for
packets the TCP SYN packets sent in the scenario, and you should
also see those packets in the Wireshark output.  However, you should not see
any return packets (e.g., the SYNACK).  That is because you are missing the
transport-layer multiplexing--the glue that passes the incoming packets to
their correct socket.

In the file `transporthost.py`, flesh out following method:

 - `handle_tcp()`.  This method takes the following as an argument:

   - `pkt`: an IP packet, complete with IP header.  Generally, this could be
     either an IPv4 or an IPv6 packet, but for the purposes of this lab, it
     will just be IPv4.

   It is called by `handle_ip()` when the packet is determined to be a TCP
   packet. `handle_tcp()` should look for a open TCP socket corresponding to
   the 4-tuple of the incoming packet. If such a mapping is found, then the
   `handle_packet()` method is called on that socket.  If no mapping of the
   4-tuple is found, then a mapping is looked for with only the local address
   and local port--i.e., a `TCPListenerSocket` instance, and the
   `handle_packet()` method is called on the corresponding socket.

   See several examples of where `install_socket_tcp()` and
   `install_listener_tcp()` are called for client and server, respectively, in
   `scenario2.py`.

   If there is no mapping of either type found, then call the `no_socket_tcp()`
   method.  At this point, you do not need to flesh out the `no_socket_tcp()`
   method; it is simply a placeholder.


## Testing

Test your implementation against scenario 2.  _Before_ the service has been
started, the output should reflect that there is no active socket on the given
IP address and port.  However, _after_ the service has been started, the output
should reflect the TCP three-way handshake, but only when the an initial packet
has the `SYN` flag set.  After the exchange between hosts `a` and `b`, you
should see output for a similar exchange between hosts `c` and `b`.

When it is working properly, test also with the `--terminal=none` option, and
make sure it works for both scenarios:

```
$ cougarnet --native-apps=none --disable-ipv6 --terminal=none scenario1.cfg
$ cougarnet --native-apps=none --disable-ipv6 --terminal=none scenario2.cfg
```


# General Helps

 - You can modify `scenario1.py`, `scenario2.py`, and the corresponding
   configuration files all you want for testing and for experimentation.  If
   this helps you, please do it!  Just note that your submission will be graded
   using only your `headers.py`, `test_headers.py`, `mysocket.py`, and
   `transporthost.py` files.  The other files used will be the stock files
   [you were provided](#resources-provided).
 - Save your work often, especially after you move from part to part.  You are
   welcome (and encouraged) to use a version control repository, such as
   GitHub.  However, please ensure that it is a private repository!


# Submission

Use the following commands to create a directory, place your working files in
it, and tar it up:

```bash
$ mkdir transport-lab
$ cp headers.py test_headers.py transporthost.py mysocket.py transport-lab
$ tar -zcvf transport-lab.tar.gz transport-lab
```
